## Project Record

### Summary: This is data from a factorial experiment with Drosophila melanogaster in which larvae were raised on control (C) and dietary restriction (DR) nutrition conditions. Eclosed flies from each treatment were split between C and DR diets followed by measurement of fecundity and lifespan of adult flies. Two replicates were made for each diet treatment resulting into 8 total cages.

`InitialProcess.R`
- `source("PreProcess_lifespan_functions.R")`
- Process raw data for male and female separately.
Input: `/data/processed/ee_lifespan_only.txt`
Output: `/data/processed/Female_events_eelife.txt` and `/data/processed/Male_events_eelife.txt`


`ee_InitialProcess.R`
- attempt to include both sexes. Not usable yet.
Input: `/data/processed/ee_lifespan_only.txt`

STEP 1: Initial processing of raw data

STEP 2: Exploration analyses


STEP 3: Two-way ANOVA

STEP 4: Generalized linear mixed models

STEP 4: A Bayesian approach



## Project Notes 

### 2018-07- 17(EN)
- Performed a work-around by combining female and male events. This is done at the top of `eeSurv_model_visual.Rmd`. The merged data frame is in the object `eelife`
- Calculated Kaplan-Meier plots various treatment combinations.

### 2018-07-12 (EN)
- Performed initial processing of lifespan data with `InitialProcess.R` modified to calculate `NstartF` and `NstartM` from observed `nDead` separately.
- Started a parallel script `ee_InitialProcess.R` to include both males and females (fixme!)
